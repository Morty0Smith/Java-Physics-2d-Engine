# Java-Physics-2d-Engine
A little physics engine, I am currently working on. It doesn't have the best code or performance and everything runs on the CPU, so don't use this code for anything serius. I am just doing this for fun and learning purpusses. Still if you can take anything away from this code, that's great! The only thing, I really don't want is anything relted to generative AI. I explicitly forbid anyone from using my work for the purpuse of generative AI, especially big tech companies. I am so sick of this shit.
